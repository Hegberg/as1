Youtube Video Link
a note about the video, made some small ui changes (added a 
text field to add_entry view and edit_entry view, to help with 
user understanding) after the video, so there is a small ui 
difference from the app to the video. No code changes though.

Also as a note, didn't know exactly what files you did or didn't need for the src file, so just put complete project structure into as1/src
